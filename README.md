## Linear Discriminant Analysis
1. Read [The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, Fisher, 1936](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x), at least until the second paragraph of Section III. Follow [this python file](fisher_lda_1936.py) for better understanding.
2. Read the section "4.1 Gaussian Discriminant Analysis" in [CS229 lecture notes](https://cs229.stanford.edu/notes2022fall/main_notes.pdf).
3. Read the section "4.3 Linear Discriminant Analysis" in the book [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/printings/ESLII_print12_toc.pdf).
4. LDA is mentioned in the section 2.2.2 of [Distance Metric Learning for Large Margin Nearest Neighbor Classification](https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume10/weinberger09a/weinberger09a.pdf), in the context of the data preprocessing for kNN classification.
